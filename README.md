# Get a DM in Slack when mentioned in a Jira Comment!

## What is this App?
Read about how Group Nine created an application that sends us direct messages in Slack when we get mentioned in Jira comments: https://medium.com/group-nine-media-product-team/slack-notifications-for-jira-comments-1d57879bc149

## Getting notifications up and running for a user
1. Make sure the user you are setting up has both a Slack and a Jira account created and is logged in on both.
1. As the new user, in slack scroll down on the side menu and click the `+` button next to `Apps`.
1. Select the `Jira Comment Bot` from the list of apps
1. Once added, in the new channel for `jira_comment_bot` type: `signup`.
1. This will prompt the bot to respond with a signup link. Click the link to open a new page. (**Note**: make sure your browser has your jira account in it's cookies as we use this to authenticate.)
1. The page will hang, this is okay and a known bug. Wait 30 seconds before closing the page.
1. Now as an Admin user, sign in to the hosted heroku app and navigate to the mongodb hosted instance on `mlab`
1. In the `mlab` database delete the newly created user.
1. Once the new user is deleted notifiy the new user to click the `signup` link again.
1. This time it should prompt the new user with an oauth screen. Accept the and signin.
1. That's it! The new user should be all setup with the jira comment bot and should receive notifications when @mentioned.

*step by step video on YouTube*

To setup this application you'll need:
- A Heroku account
- Admin access to your Slack instance
- Admin access to your Jira instance (this setup assumes you're using Jira Cloud)

1. **Setup a Slack application**
  - Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and click "Create New App"
  - Provide an Application Name ("Jira Comment Bot" seems to work well), and choose your Slack workspace from the dropdown
  - Click "Bot Users" in the "Features" section of the left-side navigation and then click "Add a Bot User"
  - Give your bot a display name and default user name and click "Add Bot User"
  - Go to "OAuth & Permissions" in the "Features section of the left-side navigation" and click "Install App to Workspace" (click Authorize on the confirmation screen)
  - Take note of the OAuth Access Token and Bot User OAuth Access Token, we'll need this later
2. **Create a Private / Public RSA Keypair for the Jira Application**
  - To create the key pair, open your terminal and type ```openssl genrsa -out privkey.pem 2048```
  - To extract the public key, type the following into your terminal ```openssl rsa -pubout -in privkey.pem -out pubkey.pem```
  - Open privkey.pem in your favorite text editor (privkey.pem should have been generated by the previous steps)
  - Go to https://www.base64encode.org/ and paste the contents of privkey.pem into the top section and click "Encode"
  - Take note of the base64 encoded string that was generated in the bottom section
3. **Setup the app on Heroku**
  - Create an account on Heroku: https://signup.heroku.com/ (a free solution for hosting applications)
 Â - Click this deploy button to deploy this app to Heroku ðŸ‘‰Â [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/msolomonTMG/jira-comment-slack-notification/tree/master)
  - When asked to enter values for environment variables, do the following...

    - JIRA_URL = the URL of your Jira application ("https://YOUR-JIRA-SUBDOMAIN.atlassian.net") the lack of a trailing slash is important  
    - RSA_PRIVATE_KEY = the base64 encoded string from step 2  
    - SLACKBOT_TOKEN = the Bot User OAuth Access Token from step 1
    - SLACKBOT_OAUTH_TOKEN = the OAuth Access Token from step 1
4. **Setup a Jira Application Link**

## Development
- When working locally, create a .env file in your local environment with the same Key=Value pairs that were used in Step 3 separated by new lines. Example: JIRA_URL='https://YOUR-URL.atlassian.net'  
- Start up Mongo with ```mongod``` in your terminal
- Install the heroku CLI to start your development environment with ```heroku local web```
