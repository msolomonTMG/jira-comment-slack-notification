# Get a DM in Slack when mentioned in a Jira Comment!

## Setup Instructions
To setup this application you'll need:
- A Heroku account
- Admin access to your Slack instance
- Admin access to your Jira instance (this setup assumes you're using Jira Cloud)

1. **Setup a Slack application**
  - Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and click "Create New App"
  - Provide an Application Name ("Jira Comment Bot" seems to work well), and choose your Slack workspace from the dropdown
  - Click "Bot Users" in the "Features" section of the left-side navigation and then click "Add a Bot User"
  - Give your bot a display name and default user name and click "Add Bot User"
  - Go to "OAuth & Permissions" in the "Features section of the left-side navigation" and click "Install App to Workspace" (click Authorize on the confirmation screen)
  - Take note of the OAuth Access Token and Bot User OAuth Access Token, we'll need this later
2. **Create a Private / Public RSA Keypair for the Jira Application**
  - To create the key pair, open your terminal and type ```openssl genrsa -out privkey.pem 2048```
  - To extract the public key, type the following into your terminal ```openssl rsa -pubout -in privkey.pem -out pubkey.pem```
  - Open privkey.pem in your favorite text editor (privkey.pem should have been generated by the previous steps)
  - Go to https://www.base64encode.org/ and paste the contents of privkey.pem into the top section and click "Encode"
  - Take note of the base64 encoded string that was generated in the bottom section
3. **Setup the app on Heroku**
  - Create an account on Heroku: https://signup.heroku.com/ (a free solution for hosting applications)
  - Click this deploy button to deploy this app to Heroku 👉 [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/msolomonTMG/jira-comment-slack-notification/tree/master)
  - When asked to enter values for environment variables, do the following...

    - APP_URL = the URL of this heroku application ("https://WHATEVER-YOU-NAMED-THIS.herokuapp.com/") the trailing slash is important  
    - JIRA_URL = the URL of your Jira application ("https://YOUR-JIRA-SUBDOMAIN.atlassian.net") the lack of a trailing slash is important  
    - RSA_PRIVATE_KEY = the base64 encoded string from step 2  
    - SLACKBOT_TOKEN = the Bot User OAuth Access Token from step 1
    - SLACKBOT_OAUTH_TOKEN = the OAuth Access Token from step 1
4. **Setup a Jira Application Link**
  - Go to https://YOUR-JIRA-SUBDOMAIN.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/applinks/listApplicationLinks
  - Enter the URL of your heroku app and click "Create New Link" (if you get a "no response" error, just click Continue)
    
    - Application Name = whatever you'd like, or just use "Jira Comments in Slack"  
    - Display Url = your Heroku app URL
    - Request Token URL, Access Token URL, and Authorize URL = https://YOUR-HEROKU-APP-NAME.herokuapp.com/auth/atlassian-oauth
    - Consumer Key = "neptune-the-dodle"
5. **Add Features to Slack App**
  - Go back the Slack Application that you setup in step 1 and go to "Interactive Components" on the left-side navigation
    - Enter "https://YOUR-HEROKU-APP-NAME.herokuapp.com/response-from-slack" in the "Request URL" field & save
  - Go to "Event Subscriptions" in the "Request URL" field enter, https://YOUR-HEROKU-APP-NAME.herokuapp.com/msg-wake-up
    - Subscribe to the message.im event
6. **Sign Up**
